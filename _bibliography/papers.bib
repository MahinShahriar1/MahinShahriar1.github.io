  abstract  = {Transmission lines are essential to power systems, necessitating the implementation of robust fault detection systems to maintain stability and operational efficiency, especially when contemporary infrastructure escalates demand. This paper presents an innovative method utilizing sophisticated deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), to effectively identify and categorize transmission line faults. Phasor data for voltage and current across several fault scenarios is produced using Simulink and MATLAB, thereafter converted into two-dimensional Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) images to encapsulate spatial patterns for accurate fault identification. The amalgamation of transfer learning and fine-tuning markedly elevates the efficacy of pre-trained CNN models, while the inclusion of ViTs further augments both detection velocity and precision, rendering the methodology appropriate for real-time applications. Furthermore, a consolidated prediction model obviates the necessity for explicit phasor recognition, hence streamlining implementation in real-world applications. The results indicate an effective, scalable, and prompt method for fault detection and classification, providing a significant enhancement to the resilience and dependability of contemporary power grids.},
