  abstract  = {Transmission lines are essential to power systems, necessitating the implementation of robust fault detection systems to maintain stability and operational efficiency, especially when contemporary infrastructure escalates demand. This paper presents an innovative method utilizing sophisticated deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), to effectively identify and categorize transmission line faults. Phasor data for voltage and current across several fault scenarios is produced using Simulink and MATLAB, thereafter converted into two-dimensional Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) images to encapsulate spatial patterns for accurate fault identification. The amalgamation of transfer learning and fine-tuning markedly elevates the efficacy of pre-trained CNN models, while the inclusion of ViTs further augments both detection velocity and precision, rendering the methodology appropriate for real-time applications. Furthermore, a consolidated prediction model obviates the necessity for explicit phasor recognition, hence streamlining implementation in real-world applications. The results indicate an effective, scalable, and prompt method for fault detection and classification, providing a significant enhancement to the resilience and dependability of contemporary power grids.},

  abstract  = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among the best options for applications involving the detection and classification of transmission line faults. In this paper, a custom CNN architecture is developed, along with transfer learning using pre-trained CNN models, to enhance fault classification accuracy. Each model utilizes the voltage phasor A vs. time graph of all types of faults as input for the image classifier. A Simulink model of a 220 kV, 200 km transmission line is used to generate voltage signals under various fault conditions. Subsequently, these signals are encoded into two-dimensional Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images. The resulting image dataset is used to train different CNN models capable of extracting distinctive features from the images to detect and classify different fault conditions. In terms of detecting and classifying fault types, the proposed CNN model achieved an accuracy of 90-93\%, outperforming pre-trained models such as ResNet and EfficientNet. A comparison between the proposed and other pre-trained models is also studied to show the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.},
