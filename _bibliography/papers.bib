  abstract  = {Transmission lines are essential to power systems, necessitating the implementation of robust fault detection systems to maintain stability and operational efficiency, especially when contemporary infrastructure escalates demand. This paper presents an innovative method utilizing sophisticated deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), to effectively identify and categorize transmission line faults. Phasor data for voltage and current across several fault scenarios is produced using Simulink and MATLAB, thereafter converted into two-dimensional Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) images to encapsulate spatial patterns for accurate fault identification. The amalgamation of transfer learning and fine-tuning markedly elevates the efficacy of pre-trained CNN models, while the inclusion of ViTs further augments both detection velocity and precision, rendering the methodology appropriate for real-time applications. Furthermore, a consolidated prediction model obviates the necessity for explicit phasor recognition, hence streamlining implementation in real-world applications. The results indicate an effective, scalable, and prompt method for fault detection and classification, providing a significant enhancement to the resilience and dependability of contemporary power grids.},

  abstract  = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among the best options for applications involving the detection and classification of transmission line faults. In this paper, a custom CNN architecture is developed, along with transfer learning using pre-trained CNN models, to enhance fault classification accuracy. Each model utilizes the voltage phasor A vs. time graph of all types of faults as input for the image classifier. A Simulink model of a 220 kV, 200 km transmission line is used to generate voltage signals under various fault conditions. Subsequently, these signals are encoded into two-dimensional Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images. The resulting image dataset is used to train different CNN models capable of extracting distinctive features from the images to detect and classify different fault conditions. In terms of detecting and classifying fault types, the proposed CNN model achieved an accuracy of 90-93\%, outperforming pre-trained models such as ResNet and EfficientNet. A comparison between the proposed and other pre-trained models is also studied to show the relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.},

  abstract  = {The paper introduces a machine learning model designed to forecast daily maximum load demand (MW) for the Dhaka city grid, utilizing historical time-series data and meteorological factors. The proposed model integrates advanced Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers, to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies in the data. The dataset incorporates weather features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation, along with temporal factors like government holidays that significantly influence electricity demand. Data pre-processing involves scaling, feature engineering, and a sliding window technique to capture temporal dependencies. The model architecture includes SimpleRNN layers for short-term pattern recognition, followed by LSTM and GRU layers for long-term dependency modeling, with batch normalization and dropout techniques applied to prevent over-fitting and enhance convergence. The results show that the model provides highly accurate load forecasts, which can assist utility companies in resource management, cost reduction, and energy planning in Dhaka city. This study presents a custom-built dataset and a specialized deep learning model, offering a valuable contribution to future advancements in electrical power management systems.},

  preview   = {ANN.gif},
  abstract  = {Accurate load flow analysis is crucial for power system studies. While traditional methods like the Newton-Raphson algorithm are widely used, deep learning (DL) techniques are emerging as promising alternatives. This paper presents a new approach that utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict load flow solutions, reducing the reliance on iterative calculations. Load flow analysis is first performed using the Newton-Raphson method to generate data for training the ANN, which is then used to predict system variables based on load inputs. The ANN's predictions are compared with those from the Newton-Raphson method to assess both accuracy and computational efficiency. Tested on the IEEE-4 bus system, the ANN model successfully replicates the load flow results, offering potential advantages in managing complex, nonlinear load patterns. This study illustrates the growing intersection between classical power system analysis methods and artificial neural network architectures.},
