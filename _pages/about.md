First, Let me introduce myself. I am a recent graduate from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work under the guidance of Dr. Abdul Hasib Chowdhury on fault detection in transmission lines of power system networks. This experience allowed me to implement various CNN models and computer vision architectures in power systems, smart grids, and microgrids. With this background, I am eager to pursue postgraduate studies, with a focus on exploring the applications of AI in power systems and delving deeper into the fascinating world of smart grids and microgrids.
